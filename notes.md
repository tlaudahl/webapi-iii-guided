# Middleware Notes

** Everything is Middleware!! **

- Almost Everything

## Types (based on how we got it or who built it)

- built-in: included with express. ex: `express.json()`
- third party.
- custom.

## Types (based on how it's being used)

- global: runs on every request

- Order Matters, it goes top to bottom and left to right
